 * This is a wrapper function around malloc from <stdlib.h>. It tries to
 * allocate the requested memory and checks if the memory was correctly
 * allocated. If not, an error is printed using err(), which describes the
 * file and linenumber and size failed to allocate. After this, the program
 * exits. See also the defines in loki_memory.h.

/**
 * @brief Calculate the number of edges connecting classes in orthogonal MSTs
 *
 * @details
 * Calculates `nTrees` orthogonal minimal spanning trees and counts how many
 * edges connect nodes with different labels. Returns the total number of such
 * edges for all trees.
 *
 * Because we can't guarantee that nTrees orthogonal MSTs can be constructed 
 * (think about the situation where tree one connects n-1 vertices to a single 
 * vertex), we keep track instead of the number of successfully constructed 
 * trees. In the end, we return the number of cross-connections and the number 
 * of successfully constructed orthogonal MSTs through the input pointers.
 *
 * Note that we use long type for integers because that's what Python 3 uses.
 *

 * @param[out] 	count_ret	number of cross connections
